Bezel reflex game
=================

This is game written for Tizen S2 Gear wearable device.

Game generally is variation/mix of of pong, arkanoid, tetris.

Game modes
----------

It is intended to have several modes:

  - ball is shot from center, with constant angle, speed.
    Player is supposed to match ball color to appropriate colored block.
    Game ends when ball is missed.

  - ball is shot from center, with random angle, speed (random, but increasing).
    Player is supposed to match ball color to appropriate colored block.
    Game ends - when:
      a) lifes are depleted
      b) or in different mode blocks disappear when hit with wrong color

  - survival mode, multiple balls are spawned dynamically.
      a) Player's goal is to catch most of them in order to gain most points in set period of time.
      b) Player's goal is to get as far as he can, handling many balls (no time limit)
         (Note for me, as in this flash game, where you were supposed to cut apples)

  - single dash rotates, ball does not disappear - simple pong game.

  - planned: dashes get closer to center - tetris/arkanoid mode.
